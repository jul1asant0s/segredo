# DO NOT CHEAT!

![image](assets/img/angry_diana.png "Seriously, do not!")

This project was written with much love, but no server-side processing. That means all the pages and answers are available right here, if you know where to look.

Of course, that would ruin most of the fun and you would skip over all the content I spread outside of github.

So be a good boy for me and don't go over these files before finishing, okay?

_Promise?_
